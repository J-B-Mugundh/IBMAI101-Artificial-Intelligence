## Problem Statement

Unveiling Customer Behaviour through Association Analysis: Utilize market basket analysis on the provided dataset to uncover hidden patterns and associations between products, aiming to understand customer purchasing behaviour and identify potential cross-selling opportunities for the retail business.<br>

Dataset for this project on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis).

## Market basket analysis with Apriori algorithm

The retailer wants to target customers with suggestions on itemset that a customer is most likely to purchase. I was given dataset contains data of a retailer; the transaction data provides data around all the transactions that have happened over a period of time. Retailer will use result to grove in his industry and provide for customer suggestions on itemset, we be able increase customer engagement and improve customer experience and identify customer behavior. I will solve this problem with use Association Rules type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item.

## Introduction
Association Rule is most used when you are planning to build association in different objects in a set. It works when you are planning to find frequent patterns in a transaction database. It can tell you what items do customers frequently buy together and it allows retailer to identify relationships between the items.

An Example of Association Rules
Assume there are 100 customers, 10 of them bought Computer Mouth, 9 bought Mat for Mouse and 8 bought both of them.

bought Computer Mouth => bought Mat for Mouse
support = P(Mouth & Mat) = 8/100 = 0.08
confidence = support/P(Mat for Mouse) = 0.08/0.09 = 0.89
lift = confidence/P(Computer Mouth) = 0.89/0.10 = 8.9
This just simple example. In practice, a rule needs the support of several hundred transactions, before it can be considered statistically significant, and datasets often contain thousands or millions of transactions.

## Strategy
- Data Import
- Data Understanding and Exploration
- Transformation of the data 
- Running association rules
- Exploring the rules generated
- Filtering the generated rules
- Visualization of Rule
